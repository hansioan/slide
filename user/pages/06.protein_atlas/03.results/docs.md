### This section describes the [viewer page](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/protein_atlas/results) for SlideBase protein atlas genes. 

Based on the RNA and protein levels constraints, the number of resulting genes will differ. After selecting your search options from the [search page](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/docs/protein_atlas/selector) and clicking the **See Detailed Results >>**  (or the smaller **"view"** popup link) link, the user will be directed to the viewer page. 

The viewer page displays detailed information about the resulting genes and allows the user to perform actions on the resulting set such as viewing genes in the The Human Protein Atlas web tool.  The complete set of gene information and actions are displayed below.

Your selected genes are shown on the list to the left as Ensembl-RefSeq gene name pairs. A maximum number of 50 Ensembl-RefSeq gene name pairs are displayed on each page. You can use the **First**, **Prev**, **Next** and **Last** buttons located under the results list and at the bottom of the page to view a different subset. Clicking on an gene name pair shows information about that individual gene. 

There are three sections which describe a gene result:

- **Gene Annotation**: describes the Ensembl and RefSeq gene ids along with the gene name and a link to The Human Protein Atlas gene report. The same link is also displayed at the top of the panel for emphasis.

- **RNA expression** levels for the gene measured in all RNA samples.

- **Protein abundance** levels for the gene measured in all protein samples.

! Compared to the FANTOM datasets, the protein atlas results page displays less information and offers fewer options. This is because the emphasis was put on selection of genes rather than viewing information. A great deal of information can be viewed in The Human Protein Atlas directly, to which we link for each result obtained.
