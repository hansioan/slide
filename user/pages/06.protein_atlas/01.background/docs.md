[The human protein atlas](http://www.proteinatlas.org/) is a unique undertaking to profile the protein abundance in tissues  and   cells   using  antibody-based  proteomics  techniques. It  contains information for  a large  majority  of  all  human  protein-coding  genes  regarding  the expression and localization  of the corresponding proteins based on both RNA and protein  data.  

The  tissue  atlas  contains   information  of  44  different  human  tissues and  organs  with  annotation  data  for altogether  83  different  cell  types.  The transcriptomics data provide quantitative data on gene expression levels across the tissues  and  organs,  while  the  antibody-based  protein  profiles  show  the  spatial distribution  at  a  single  cell  level  for  the  corresponding  protein  in  the  various substructures and cell types of the tissues.  In SlideBase, we present the possibility to select genes based on gene expression or protein abundance, or a combination of the two.
