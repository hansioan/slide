As part of  [FANTOM5](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/),  492  short  RNA  libraries were made, corresponding   to mostly  primary  cells  across  the  human  body.  

These  were  mapped  to  known miRNAs  from  [miRBase](http://www.mirbase.org/),  resulting  in  940   miRNAs  that  passed  high-confidence thresholds.  Each  such  miRNA  was  then   annotated  by  the  sRNA  expression, resulting in an <a>atlas of miRNA expression</a> across primary cells.
