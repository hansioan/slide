### What is SlideBase?
Large consortia such as [FANTOM](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/) ,  [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/) , [The Human Protein Atlas](http://www.proteinatlas.org/) and [GTEx](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa0355) are producing comprehensive datasets for as a result of measurements of molecular states of cells and tisses on different functional levels. 

These atlases are uselful for understanding biology and diseases and describe expression of a multitude of genomic features such as gene promoters, miRNAs, proteins and enhancer regions.

Even so, it can be difficult to navigate such complex data sets if the user is not accustomed with the detailed aspects behind the research process. In addition, the lack of intuitive methods for selection of expressed genomic features of interest can limit the usage of such data sets by the community. Pre-defining and exploring the data sets can also become a challenge especially because expression thresholds are typically best defined by users, according to individual needs.  

** To this extent we present [SlideBase](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk)( http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk ), a tool that uses sliders to select expressed features from a given dataset by user-customized expression thresholds through the use of interacting sliders.**
