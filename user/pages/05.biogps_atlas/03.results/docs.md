### This section describes the [viewer page](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/biogps_atlas/results) for BioGPS U133 genes. 

Based on the expression constraints, the number of resulting genes will differ. After selecting your search options from the [search page](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/docs/biogps_atlas/selector) and clicking the **See Detailed Results >>**  (or the smaller **"view"** popup link) link, the user will be directed to the viewer page. 

The viewer page displays detailed information about the resulting genes and allows the user to perform actions on the resulting set such as viewing genes in the BioGPS Gene Report.  The complete set of gene information and actions are displayed below.

Your selected genes are shown on the list to the left as probeset-gene name pairs. A maximum number of 50 probeset-gene pairs are displayed on each page. You can use the **First**, **Prev**, **Next** and **Last** buttons located under the results list and at the bottom of the page to view a different subset. Clicking on an probeset-gene pair shows information about that individual gene with respect to that probe. 

There are two sections which describe a probeset-gene result:

- **Annotation details**: describes the probeset and gene ids along with the gene name and a link to the BioGPS Gene Report. The same link is also displayed at the top of the panel for emphasis.

- **Percentage and expression** levels for the probeset-gene pair measured in all samples.

!!! <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> **Note:**
!!! + When viewing information in the BioGPS Gene Report tool remember to select the appropriate probeset. This message is also shown at the top of the "Expression Details" panel in the viewer page.

! Compared to the FANTOM datasets, the BioGPS results page displays less information and offers less options. This is because the emphasis was put on selection of genes rather than viewing information. A great deal of information can be viewed in BioGPS directly, to which we link for each result obtained.
