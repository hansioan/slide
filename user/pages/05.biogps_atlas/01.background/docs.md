[BioGPS](http://biogps.org/)  was  initially  created  as  a  mechanism  to  disseminate  reference  gene expression  data   sets  online of  human  and  mouse.   In  particular,  many  diverse mouse  and  human  tissues  mouse  tissues  were  systematically  profiled  using Affymetrix tiling arrays. 

BioGPS has grown to now  a gene based portal, which can be customized to different types of data.  In  SlideBase, we  have  focused  on  human  expression  atlas,  specifically  from  the U133 Affymetrix chip. In SlideBase, the unit that is searchable are affymetrix probe IDs,  usually  corresponding  to  annotated genes, and associated  with  the  gcrma-normalized expression data from that probe.
