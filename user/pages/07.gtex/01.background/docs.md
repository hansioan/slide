The [GTEx](http://www.gtexportal.org/)  project is a large-scale effort to profile gene expression in a wide range of tissues and individuals using RNA-seq in combination with genotyping of the same individuals, enabling the detection of quantitative trait loci. In SlideBase, we were interested in overall expression patterns across tissues rather than genetics. As a result we created sliders corresponding to the median expression across individuals for 53 tissues in GTEx.
