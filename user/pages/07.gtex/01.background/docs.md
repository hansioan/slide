The [GTEx](http://www.gtexportal.org/)  project is a large-scale effort to profile gene expression in a wide range of tissues and individuals using RNA-seq in combination with genotyping of the same individuals, enabling the detection of quantitative trait loci. In Slidebase, we were interested in overall expression patters across tissues rather than genetics, we created sliders corresponding the median expression across individuals for 53 tissues in GTEx.
