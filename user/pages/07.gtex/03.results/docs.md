### This section describes the [viewer page](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/gtex/results) for GTEx V6 genes. 

Based on the expression constraints, the number of resulting genes will differ. After selecting your search options from the [search page](http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/docs/gtex/selector) and clicking the **See Detailed Results >>**  (or the smaller **"view"** popup) link, the user will be directed to the viewer page. 

The viewer page displays detailed information about the resulting genes and allows the user to perform actions on the resulting set such as viewing genes in the GTEx Gene Page and GTEx eQTL Browser.  The complete set of gene information and actions are displayed below.

Your selected genes are shown on the list to the left as Ensembl-RefSeq name pairs. A maximum number of 50 Ensembl-RefSeq name pairs are displayed on each page. You can use the **First**, **Prev**, **Next** and **Last** buttons located under the results list and at the bottom of the page to view a different subset. Clicking on an name pair shows information about that individual gene with respect to that individual pair. 

There are two sections which describe a probeset-gene result:

- **Annotation details**: describes the Ensembl and RefSeq gene names links to GTEx Gene (e.g. [http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/GEN1](http://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/GEN1) ) Page and [eQTL Browser](http://www.gtexportal.org/home/browseEqtls). 

- **Percentage and expression** levels for a gene measured in all samples.

!!! <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> **Note:**
! Compared to the FANTOM datasets, the GTEx results page displays less information and offers fewer options. This is because the emphasis was put on selection of genes rather than viewing information. A great deal of information can be viewed in GTEx directly, to which we link for each result obtained.
