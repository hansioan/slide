The [FANTOM5 consortium](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/) aimed to generate 
both a map of the majority of human promoters  and   comparative  transcriptional  regulatory  network  models  of each cellular state. To achieve this they carried out CAGE sequencing on the Heliscope true  single  molecule 
sequencer on RNA isolated  from every  major  human organ, over  200  cancer  cell  lines, 30  time  courses  of cellular  differentiation,  mouse developmental  time  courses  and  over  200  primary  cell  types.   The  result  is  a unique [body-wide atlas focused specifically ](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13182)  on core promoter utilization</a>. CAGE  tags  mapping  to  the  reference  genome  were  clustered   to  tag  clusters, corresponding  to  regions  of  transcription  initiation.  

For  simplicity,  we  will  refer  to these  regions  as “promoters”.  Within  each  such   region,  we  have  a  measure  of expression within each primary cell and tissue and based on  the expression levels, an promoter can be specific to a set of primary cells and organs (tissue samples)  or can be broadly (or ubiquitously) expressed. In SlideBase, each such promoter with  associated expression data  is the unit that can be searched for.
